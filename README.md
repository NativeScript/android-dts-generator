# android-dts-generator
A tool that generates TypeScript declaration files (.d.ts) from Jars

> Because there are certain incompatibilities between Java and TypeScript, definitions MAY NOT always be completely accurate. They will however compile and provide auto complete feature inside a modern text editor supporting typings.

### Quirks
 - Interfaces are represented by classes, this will allow you to extend them by using the `new` syntax, as well as show you all its members that need to be implemented
 - Classes from the package `java.util.function` don't have their typings generated, as `function` is a reserved keyword in TypeScript and JavaScript
 - Classes returning values of Type in the package `java.util.function` will return `any` instead
 - Classes using methods with parameters of Type in the package `java.util.function` will take `any` instead
 - Classes implementing `java.util.Iterator`, `android.animation.TypeEvaluator`, `java.lang.Comparable` do not implement those interfaces in the generated definitions for compatibility-related issues
 - On OSX you need to run ```./gradlew jar``` and change "\" to "/"


### Generate definitons for Android SDK
```shell
cd dts-generator
gradlew jar
java -jar build\libs\dts-generator.jar -input %ANDROID_HOME%\platforms\android-<Platform Level (21/22/23/24)>\android.jar
```

### Generate definitions for any Jar
```shell
cd dts-generator
gradlew jar
java -jar build\libs\dts-generator.jar -input <Path to your Jar>
```

### Pass multiple jars to generator
```shell
cd dts-generator
gradlew jar
java -jar build\libs\dts-generator.jar -input <jar1> <jar2> <jar3>
```

### Generate definitions for .aar
```
Open the .aar archive
Extract the classes.jar and any dependencies it may have inside libs/
Rename classes.jar if necessary
```
```shell
java -jar build\libs\dts-generator.jar -input classes.jar dependency-of-classes-jar.jar
```
